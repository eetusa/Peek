# Peek

A minecraft (1.15) addon that gives the player a 'limited spectator mode'. The player can freely fly around in specate mode, but can't exceed a certain distance. After ending the mode, the player  continues the game from where they started the Peek mode.

This means that the player can inspect builds or redstones, but can't use the Peek mode to 'cheat' or 'fly'.

## Usage

Write /peek to toggle the mode.
